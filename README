I use tcsh(1) for day-to-day use and then sh(1) for scripting. Most bash(1)
enthusiasts don't have enough perspective to have an opinion worth listening
to. New tcsh users, enjoy the up-arrow history, tab-completion for ssh hosts,
`time long_command`, etc., ...

Here's the walkthrough:

	cd ~/src
	git clone git@github.com:sean-/cshrc.git
	cd cshrc

To INSTALL:

	% less .cshrc     # _Always_ review changes to your shell config
	% mv .cshrc ~/    # Install the configured tcsh(1) hotness
	% exec /bin/tcsh  # Start using tcsh(1)
	% chsh /bin/tcsh  # Change your default shell once you feel comfortable

To UPGRADE:

	% cd ~/src/cshrc
	% git pull
	% diff -u .cshrc ~/.cshrc
	% cp .cshrc ~/.cshrc
