  *) A .cshrc file
  *) basic .emacs files


tcsh:

I use and recommend tcsh(1) for day-to-day use and then sh(1) for
scripting. Most bash(1) use bash(1) because they've never questioned the use
of the default shell shipped by Linux.

New tcsh(1) users, scroll down for a list of immediately useful benefits.

Installation walk-through:

One-off install:
        % curl -o ~/.cshrc https://raw.github.com/sean-/cshrc/master/.cshrc

To track changes:
        % cd ~/src
        % git clone git@github.com:sean-/cshrc.git
        % cd cshrc

To INSTALL:
        % less .cshrc     # _Always_ review changes to your shell config
        % mv .cshrc ~/    # Install the configured tcsh(1) hotness
        % exec /bin/tcsh  # Start using tcsh(1)
        % chsh /bin/tcsh  # Change your default shell once you feel comfortable

To UPGRADE:
        % cd ~/src/cshrc
        % git pull
        % diff -u .cshrc ~/.cshrc
        # Merge whatever changes you've made and didn't put in a
        # ~/.local.tcsh file
        % cp .cshrc ~/.cshrc
