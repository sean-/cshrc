* Manifest
  A series of dot files for users. Included:

  - useful .cshrc
  - basic .emacs files
  - .psqlrc file for psql(1)
  - .digrc file for dig(1)
  - .cvsrc file for cvs(1) (really?? who uses this POS anymore anyway?)


* tcsh
  I use and recommend tcsh(1) for day-to-day use and then sh(1) for
  scripting. Most bash(1) use bash(1) because they've never questioned the
  use of the default shell shipped by Linux.

  New tcsh(1) users, scroll down for a list of immediately useful benefits.
