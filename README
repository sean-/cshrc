I use and recommend tcsh(1) for day-to-day use and then sh(1) for
scripting. Most bash(1) use bash(1) because they've never questioned the use
of the default shell shipped by Linux.

New tcsh(1) users, scroll down for a list of immediately useful benefits.

Installation walk-through:

One-off install:
	% curl -o ~/.cshrc https://github.com/sean-/cshrc/raw/master/.cshrc

To track changes:
	% cd ~/src
	% git clone git@github.com:sean-/cshrc.git
	% cd cshrc

To INSTALL:
	% less .cshrc     # _Always_ review changes to your shell config
	% mv .cshrc ~/    # Install the configured tcsh(1) hotness
	% exec /bin/tcsh  # Start using tcsh(1)
	% chsh /bin/tcsh  # Change your default shell once you feel comfortable

To UPGRADE:
	% cd ~/src/cshrc
	% git pull
	% diff -u .cshrc ~/.cshrc
	% cp .cshrc ~/.cshrc


New tcsh users, the biggest set of "new features" are:

*) "Up-arrow" searching through history

   cat /etc/resolv.conf    # Push something in to your history
   cd ~/                   # Execute a different command
   ca[up-arrow]            # Have the "up-arrow" search through all history
						   # entries that begin with "ca"
   cat /etc/resolv.conf    # A great time saver

*) Tab-completion of ssh hosts. e.g.

   % ssh host1[TAB]           # Yields the following:
   % ssh host01.example.com

*) Useful time information. e.g.:

   % time sudo port install py27-ipython
   Time spent in user mode   (CPU seconds) : 6.795s
   Time spent in kernel mode (CPU seconds) : 5.118s
   Total time                              : 0:31.25s
   CPU utilization (percentage)            : 38.0%
   Times the process was swapped           : 0
   Times of major page faults              : 0
   Times of minor page faults              : 0

*) Duplicates removed from history. Self-explanatory.

*) Tab completion of arguments for programs (e.g. git(1), sysctl(1), gdb(1),
   gcc(1), chown(1), ping(1), mtr(1), etc). See the 'complete' section for
   more examples or to learn how to extend argument completion for additional
   commands (feel free to suggest improvements).
